/// <summary>
/// Indicates that a type's structure is fixed and will not change,
/// allowing for more efficient ordinal-based serialization.
/// This doesn't require that memory layout is fixed, only that the order of fields is fixed.
/// 
/// This works great for types like Vector3, Quaternion, etc.
/// Since those types are always the same size and layout.
/// It also works great for network packets and other fixed-size structures, where you know the Writer and Reader will always be in sync.
/// 
/// This is highly recommended to be used when possible.
